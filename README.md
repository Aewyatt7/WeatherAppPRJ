Weather App Project
Overview
This project is a  weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to display weather data based on user input. The app provides information such as current temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

Challenges Faced
Learning about APIs
Initially, understanding how to work with APIs was an impossible concept. Researching and experimenting with the OpenWeatherMap API helped in comprehending the process of making API requests, handling responses, and extracting relevant data.
Understanding Query Selector
Getting familiar with document.querySelector() and effectively using it to target specific HTML elements was a learning curve. It took time to understand the syntax and how to manipulate HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
Styling with CSS
Implementing CSS styles to create a modern and user-friendly interface was challenging. Playing with CSS properties, layouts, and responsive design helped in improving the overall look and feel of the application.

API Integration
Started by reading API docs to understand endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
Implemented fetch() to make API requests and used async/await for handling asynchronous data.

Query Selector Usage
Practiced using document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll() to select and manipulate HTML elements.
Experimented with updating text content, attributes, and CSS classes dynamically.

CSS Styling
Utilized CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the app.
Explored various CSS properties, flexbox, and responsive design techniques to improve layout and styling.

Stronger Understanding
APIs: gained knowledge about API fundamentals, making requests, handling responses, and extracting required data.

Query Selector: mastered the usage of document.querySelector() for DOM manipulation.

CSS Styling: learned to use CSS effectively to create visually appealing and responsive web layouts.
